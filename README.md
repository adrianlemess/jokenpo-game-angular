## Board with tasks

If you would like to check how I organize my tasks, you can check my board on Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/wX98RPXL/anaconda-home-task)

## URL deployed

If you want to test the application deployed you can check [here](https://jokenpo-game-adrian.netlify.app) and if you'd like to check the static documentation generated by compodoc, check [here](https://jokenpo-adrian-docs.netlify.app).
## Resources used

* [Angular](http://angular.io) - Framework used. Version 13 choose, is the last one until the moment.
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) - Need to run the project.
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) - Manage dependencies.
* [Jest](http://jestjs.io) - Framework used for testing purpose, need for specs, spies, stubs, assertions and also supply the test runner to run the specs.
* [Testing Library](http://testing-library.com) - Cross-platform library to help with a set of utilities to be able to make integration tests easily.
*  [Material IO](https://material.angular.io) - Style library with Angular components based on Material UI
*  [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - To create containers and help to ship the project to run in an environment with support (like k8s)
*  [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) - Netlify unites an entire ecosystem of modern tools and services into a single, simple workflow for building high performance sites and apps.
* [NgBootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) - Used for the carousel component
## Requirements to run

* NodeJS LTS version v16.13.1
* VSCode
* GIT
* Angular/CLI version 13.2.5
## How to install dependencies

Install dependencies with:

```
npm ci
```

If you want to update the package-lock.json with the possible latest versions, run:

```
npm install
```

## Scripts Available
npm start -  Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

*npm run build - Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

*npm test - Run `ng test` to execute the test suite with [Jest](http://jestjs.io)

*npm run test:watch - Run `npm test` and execute tests with --watch flag mode

*npm run test:e2e - Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

*npm run prettier:check - Will run the prettier in the project with the flag --check. This will let us know if we have files that have not been formatted.

*npm run prettier:apply - If you forgot to apply prettier in some of your files, you can simple run this command

*npm run lint - This command is to run eslint using the `.eslintrc.json` file rules

*npm run lint:fix - This command is to run eslint using the `.eslintrc.json` file rules and fix any error found

*npm run compodoc:build - Build compodoc and generate the documentation

*npm run compodoc:build-and-serve - It will generate the document and serve in the port `8080`.

*npm run compodoc:serve - If you already have compodoc files generated you can simple run the serve with this command, it will run on port `8080`

*npm run cypress:open - It will open the Cypress devtools and run the tests.

*npm run cypress:run - Run Cypress on headless mode, useful to run on CI.
## Husky

I've added Husky to enable some hooks to run before commit and pushing code. I've added the following git hooks:

* pre-commit: In pre-commit I decide to run fast checkers: `npm run prettier:check` and `npm run lint`
* pre-push: In pre-push I decide to run all quality suite: `npm run prettier:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test` and `npm run build`
* commit-msg: use commit lint to enforce angular conventional and good commit messages

## Tests

## Code design

### Architecture diagram
I've started the application by thinking about the model and how I would model the application. For doing this I've decided to use two design patterns: `Strategy` and `Factory`. 

The following diagram was my initial idea:

![Architecture diagram](/docs-image/diagram.png)

Some enums are not connected because they will be used across my component and views.

I have two factories:

* JokenpoStrategyFactory - responsible to return a strategy that match with the type passed.
* HandFactory - has two method to return the hand with the correspondent strategy. 
  * create: we pass the option type and return the correspondent hand
  * createForComputer: it's a method to return with a random logic, a hand with strategy.
* As the logic to know which hand win of each hand (example: Rock x Paper), it's the logic we'd probably change in the future if we need to add a new hand, I isolated as a strategy, this way if we need to add a new hand we will not update the previous one, only the strategy layer. 

### Modules

* LayoutModule - Will have only the components shared across all routes, which is header and footer for this application. This module is for performance issues, because now we can have a `SharedModule` with the components used only in some views and not loading `SharedModule` every time.
* Core folder - All services, models, interfaces, enum, interfaces and independent files will be available here. 
## Considerations

* Moved Karma/Jasmine to Jest and Testing library, to have quick tests running and also to focus on integration tests with Testing library

## Possible improvements

* Add preview environment URL every time a PR is opened
* Add test coverage badge on Readme
## Deploy

To make the code shippable to production, I've setup two ways, the first one with Dockerfile and the second one with CI and Netlify.

### Deploy requirements

- Netlify account
- Docker installed
- Github account
- Git


### Docker

In the project directory, to build the application with Docker multistage you can build the image:

```docker build -t username/jokenpo .```

And then run your image:
```docker run --rm -it -p 3000:80 username/jokenpo```

After that, you can access the application with this URL in your browser:

```http://localhost:3000```


### Using Github Actions and Deploying into Netlify

Every code into `main` branch, trigger a pipeline with the following stages:

* Inspections: Run some commands to guarantee the quality of the code. All commands are executed in the order by time to be executed: faster -> longer
  * lint
  * prettier:check
  * test
* Build: Build and store the following artifacts
  * dist folder
  * documentation
* Deploy netlify - deploy the application from `dist` folder on Netlify
* Deploy netlify - deploy the static documentation generated inside the `documentation` folder on Netlify
